# go-to-network
Go to Network (other allowed stylations are go2network, go to network, and go-to-network) is a revolutionary cluster-computing centric, actor based, event driven programming paradigm, language, compiler and runtime that fundamentally refactors the flexibiity, high-availability and achievable resource usage of software projects to an extent never before seen. It will supersede the microservices architecture with something infinitely more agile, that will shape software architecture for the next century.

Go to Network will be built on-top of the Go programming language, compiler, runtime and online course, since it has excellent Reactive Programming faculties, but has very procedural-paradigm sensibilities, making it easy for beginners to learn. Go to Network will share many of the same syntax as Go, but will work very differently.

Each Go to Network module runs an individual event nanoservice, which intrinsically operates in tandem with a receiver nanoservice and a sender nano-service to create a code-as-data-pipeline ecosystem. Each nanoservice is infinitely scalable, to the point where you can have as many of one nanoservice as you want. This configuration allows for continuous delivery down to the op-code.

While Functional Programming is a young Paradigm that has shown to be very good at solving certain issues like Monads, Go to Network will rely on the flexibility of procedural style syntax. The Nano Service as a System will provide enough flexibility for devopers to implement their own functional programming constructs on top of the base framework.
 
As someone who has not used Go or any similar languages, I will be seeking work from experienced programmers to help develop how Go to Network will integrate with Go. So if you have any we would love you to join the Go to Network Foundationâ„¢ and help develop the future of programming.
